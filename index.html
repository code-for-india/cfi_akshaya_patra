                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>A story of compassion is the stepping stone to the beginning of The Akshaya Patra Foundation.It was one of those life-changing encounters of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada when he saw a group of children fighting with street dogs over scraps of food. This heartbreaking incident brought to fore the determination that: No one within a ten mile radius of our centre should go hungry. In June 2000, this inspiration was given the form of The Akshaya Patra Foundation to feed the children of Government schools with a thoughtful and conscientious vision of â€œNo child in India shall be deprived of education because of hunger".</p>

                        <p>In general, surveys show that since the implementation of Mid-day Meal Programme by the Government and various NGOs, there has been an upward surge in school enrolment and attendance of the children. Studies also indicate that this programme has been able to reduce drop-out rate.</p>
